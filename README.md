## About This Project

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a self-driving car simulation. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts behind autonomous vehicles in a simple, 2D environment. The simulation includes both the visual representation of the car and road, as well as the underlying neural network that drives decision-making.

## Key Features

- Real-time 2D car simulation
- Multi-lane road environment
- Sensor-based obstacle detection
- Neural network visualization
- Traffic simulation with multiple vehicles

## Project Structure

The simulation is built incrementally, with each part focusing on a specific aspect of the self-driving car:

1. **Car Driving Mechanics**: Implementation of basic car movement and controls.
2. **Road Definition**: Creation of the environment in which the car operates.
3. **Artificial Sensors**: Development of sensors to detect the car's surroundings.
4. **Collision Detection**: Implementation of mechanisms to detect and respond to collisions.
5. **Traffic Simulation**: Addition of other vehicles to create a more realistic environment.
6. **Neural Network**: Integration of a neural network to make driving decisions.

## How It Works

As shown in the screenshot:
- The left panel displays the road, the self-driving car (blue), and other traffic.
- Yellow lines represent the car's sensors detecting obstacles and lane boundaries.
- The right panel visualizes the neural network making real-time decisions.
